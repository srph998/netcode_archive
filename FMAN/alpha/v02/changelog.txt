// DESCRIPTION
This is the base V01 (alpha) edition of the server client 
structure for hu5hbot's "fishing" program. 

// DOCUMENATION
This is the basic edition of the server client structure for a
botnet in development by hu5hbot late 2024. The point is that
the server runs on an isolated recieving machine. This server is
meant to recieve / write the information given by a client. The
client is meant to perform tasks on the remote device it is
located on and send that information back to the server. 

Eventually the point will be that you can slot your own code in
place of the client's buffer-logic, maybe even able to slot
it in from the server end so you don't have to re-deploy. I am
investigating ways to do this that minimize data sent. It is a
difficult problem, as the basis for how "secure" this program
will be rides on how much data is sent back and forth that isn't
the bare minimum. It is difficult to measure how many resources
an operation uses outside of theoretically how much it "should"
use. I don't want to have to open/close a file every time it's
written to and I don't want to have to pipe every inch of data
back and forth manually.

This program has been through several iterations before this.
However, I am happy with this version as it is and wish to make
an effort to preserve it. As well as start documentation so I
don't lose the direction with the program.

// CHANGELOG
-Server accepts any number of clients. Output is cleaned as to
keep load as easy as possible. I'm curious how easy it would be
to keep track of if hundreds of clients send at once.
-Server writes data to database files (just text for now)
-Client can send any amount of information over
-Prints structure as-ran for both client/server as debug

[UPCOMING]
-Self destruct (delete executable on remote machine once done)
-Forensics (tools to gather machine data on the surface)
-Main (Write a main loop/function for the slotted code)
-Formatting Data (Format database for easy use / storage)
-Anonymize (keep the client code as secret as possible)
-Pentest (use live machines for testing code)
